Modules:
-->I AM GOING TO START AUTOMATON WITH THE MODULES.
-->Module is group /collectiono of attributes[block,elements,controls]which contains technical information present in the application.

IDENTIFICATION METHODS AVAILABLE TO SCAN THE APLLICATION:
_________________________________________________________

1)IDENTIFY BY PROPERTIES[REPRESENTATION,TECHINCAL AND TRASITION]
--->85-90% OF THE CONTROLS IDENTIFICATION WILL BE DONE BY PROPERTIES ITSELF
--->BY DEFAULT TOSCA USES PROPERTIES IDENTIFICATION METHOD WHILE SCANNING THE APPLICATION
--->**CLASS NAME,ID,INNER TEXT,OUTER TEXT,TITLE,NAME,***INNER HTML,OUTER HTML, HREF
___________________________________________________________________________________


2)IDENTIFY BY ANCHOR

--->IF THE IDENTIFICATION OF THR CONTROLS ARE NOT UNIQUE WITH THE PROPERTIES,THEN WE NEED TO USE ANCHOR IDENTIFICATION METHOD
---->HELP/REFERANCE/SUPPORT
--->IDENTIFICATION A CONTROL "BOOKS WITH THE HELP /SUPPORT/REFERANCE OF THE ANOTHER CONTROL "REGISTER",IT IS CALLED AS IDENTIFICATION BY ANCHOR
-->ANY CONTROL WHICH IS UNIQUE,SHOULD BE STABLE.
___________________________________________________________________________________


3)IDENTIFY BY INDEX
4)IDENTIFY BY IMAGE


TEST CASE:
_________
IT IS STEP BY STEP PROCESS RELATED OR SPECIFIC OF ANY FUNCTIONALITY OR PROCESS.

WILD CARDS:
___________
-->TOSCA WILL IGNORE ALL THE CHARCTORS, AFTER THE DEMO WEB SHOP(NO MATCHING TERM IS FORMED)
--->WILD CARD IS USED WHEN THERE IS AN ERROR,WHCIH COMES NO MATCHING TEARM FOUND(WHEN U EXECUTING THE STEP TITLE OF THE PAGE IS NOT MATCHING WITH MODULE WHAT WE HAVE CREATED)
-->WHID CARD USED WHEN THERE IS AN ERROR WHICH COMES LIKE NO MATCHING TERM WAS FOUND WHEN  THERE IS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TITLE WHEN IM EXECUTING WHEN I'M STAND.

ACTION MODES:
_____________

1)INPUT--> IF WE WANT TO PROVIDE DATE TO ANY CONTROL
2)VERIFY-->IF U WANT TO VERIFY ANT CONTROL/TEXT/CONTENT
3)BUFFER-->BUFFER IS A TEMPORARY STORAGE TO STORE THE VALUE AND CAN BE USED AT LATER POINT OF TIME
4)WAIT ON-->CONCEPT OF SYNCHRONIZATION (COMMUINICATION BETWEEN TWO OBJECTS AT SAME TIME)

-->STATIC WAIT -> TBOX WAIT
-->DYNAMIC WAIT --> CAN BE ACHEVIED BY USING ACTION MODE WAIT ON

5)SELECT-->WILL BE USED FOR ONLY WEB TABLES IN AN APPLICATION.
6)CONSTRAINT

RANDOM NUMBERS ---> {RND[NO.OF DIGITS]}  --> {RND[6]} ---> 996543/677889/987654

RANDOM TEXT ---> {RANDOMTEXT[NO.OF DIGITS]}  --> {RANDOMTEXT[6]} ---> URTH4T,IUTIO9
RANDOM REGULAR EXPRESSION --> IF WE WANT TO GENERATE ANY DYNAMIC EXPRESSION ON A SPECIFIC FORMAT "RRE"

TEST CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS:
______________________________


--->CAN ALSO BE CALLED AS T.C.P /CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
--->DEFINED AS CONFIGURING /SPECIFYING THE TEST CASES WITH A SPECFIC SET OF VALUES/INPUTS/DATA
z

1.BROWSER RELATED INFO
2.SYNCHRONISATION RELATED INFO
3.SCREEN SHOT RELATED INFO
4.NORMAL/ GENARIC DATA INFO


SYNATAX:
________

{CP[NAME OF THE VALUE]}

LIBRARIES:
_________


--->CONCEPT OF REUSABLITY CAN BE ACHEIVED WITH LIBRARIES.
--->LIBRARY IS GROUP/COLLECTION OF RE USABLE TEST STEP BLOCKS WHICH ARE COMMON IN NATURE AND CAN BE USED ACROSS MUTLTIPLE TEST CASES 

---->EFFORTS WOULD BR SAVED
---->TIME WILL BE SAVED AND MAINTAINENCE BECOMES EASY,Placements driver updates


BUSINESS PARAMETERS:

--->IT WILL ALOOW US TO CHANGE THE TEST STEPS WHICH ARE USED / TAKEN FROM LIBRARY

--> SYNTAX:
{PL[NAME OF B.P]}
{B[NAME OF BUFFER]}
{CP[NAME OF CP]}
 
   TCP                                                   BP
WILL BE CREATED ON TEST CASES               CREATED ON LIBRARY
SPECIFIC SET OF VALUES                    CHANGE THE DATA
{CP[NAME OF CP]}                         {PL[NAME OF BP]}
SINGLE TEST CASE                     WILL UPDATE IN ALL REFERCES

15)RECOVERY SCENARIOS

16)LOOPS AND CONDITIONS:

CONDITONAL STATEMENTS
 IF STATEMENT

IF CONDITION []
YES 
THEN---->ACTION
NO
ELSE---.ACTION

LOOPS: IF WE WANT TO PREPARE A SPECIFIC SET OF ACTION FOR REPEATED NUMBER OF TIMES THEN WE WILL BE USING THE LOOPS

WHIEL
GO - WHILE

STATIC BUFFER:
BUFFER:BUFFER IS A TEMPORARY STORAGE USED TO STORE THE SPECIFIC CONTENT AND CAN ALSO BE USED RE RESUED {B[NAME OF THE BUFFER]}

-->THERE ARE SOME STANDARD MODULES TO LEARN STATIC BUFFER

1.TBOX SET BUFFER
2.TBOX NAME TO BUFFER
3.TBOX PARTIAL BUFFER




DYNAMIC BUFFER:

---->THERE IS NO STANDARD MODULE TO BUFFER A VALUE DYANAMICALLY 
----->IF WE WANT TO STORE ANY DYAAMIC VALUE WHICH IS GENERATED BY APPLICATION
----->ITS JUST AN EXPRESSION METHOD TO VERIFY THE CONTENT.

OTDER NUMBER:019220393

ACTION MODE:VERIFY

DATA EXPRESSIONS IN TOSCA:


{DATE[BASEDATA][OFFSET][FORMAT]}
 

BASEDATA = FROM WHICJH DATE U WANT TO PERFORM ACTION/WRITE AN EXPRESSION
OFFSET   = CALCULATIONS U ANT TO PERFORM
FORMAT   = IN WHICH FORMAT WE WANT OUTPUT


{DATE[][][]}

{DATE[][+2M][DD,MM,YYYY]}

MARCH 31, 2021

TEST CASE DESIGN SECTION IN TOSCA:
__________________________________

--->CAN ALSP BE CALEED AS TCD
--->TSC IS USED IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DATA ,CREATE DATA AND USE/ LINK THE DATRA TO THE TEST CASES.
--->TCD IS A PRE DEFINED ADD IN AS PART OF STANDARG INSTALLATION.
--->CAN ALSO BR CALLED AS DATA DRIVEN TESTING/FRAMEWORK

COMPONENTS / TERMINOLOGIES USED IN TCD:

1.TEST SHEETS---> ACTS LIKE A SOURCE /PRE DEFINED TEMPLETE TO START CREATE CREATING DATA.
2.ATTRIBUTES  --->CONTROLS / ELEMENTS /OBJECTS
3.INSTANCES -->POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF THE ATTRIBUTES --> actual data contains here.

----> FOR EACH AND EVERY REQUIRMENTS / FUNCTIONALITY IN THE APPLICATION U CAN CREATE THE DATA IN TCD.
________________________________________________________________________
1.TEMPLATED ---> ANY PARTICULAR / STANDARD / PRE-DEFINED FORMAT
2.TEMPLATE INSTANCES

->CINVERT YOUR TEST CASES IN TO A TEMPLATE
->DRAG AND DROP YOUR TEST SHEET OM TO TEMPLATE
->WILL GENARATE THE TEMPLATE INSTANCES
_________________________________________________________________________
 

CLASSES IN TOSCA:

CLASS IS GROUP OR COLLECTION OF REUSABLE ATTRIBUTES WHICH ARE OF COMMON IN NATURE AND CAN BE USED ACROSS MUTLIPLE TEST SHEETS
 
CLASSES IN TCD IS SIMILAR TO THE CONCEPT LIBRAIES IN TEST CASES
